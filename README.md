# Overview
This game is a platform game where you must run from the mice on the platforms. You have three lives and everytime you hit a mouse you lose one of your lives. 

This specific program is soley for entertainment and to help me learn the python arcade library a little bit better. 
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

* Adding points or an objective to the program
* Import my own file as a background to the game
